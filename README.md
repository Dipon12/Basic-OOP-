### About Object

Object has two things:
- Attribute/Properties - Basically, Data Regarding Object (If Person is object, then persons height,weight) [Variable of the class]
- Behaviour - Actions that defines what the object does (If Person is object then it dances/Sings) [Methods of the class]

**Class is the design for a Object/Instance.**

### Constructor

In Python, _def init_ method is the **CONSTRUCTOR** method. Constructor is the method that is executed whenever the class is called. It is used to store instance variable. 

 We can think that, each instance is different types of 'variable' of that class. Means, class is the type of instance variable.

 Each object will have their own Variable and Methods.

 **What the Constructor method actually does???**

 Ans: Everytime a instance/object of a class is created, memory is allocated from Heap for that instance/object. But how to determine the size of the instance? Of course it depends on the class which is further depended how much variables are used in that class. That is where Constructor comes to help. It determines the size to take for the instance.

 Every time you create an object it is allocated to new space.
